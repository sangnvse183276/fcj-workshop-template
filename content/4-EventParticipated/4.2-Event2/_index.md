### Discover Agentic AI – Amazon QuickSuite Workshop

**- Date:** November 7, 2025
**- Location:** AWS Vietnam Office, Bitexco Financial Tower, HCMC


---

#### Event Overview

An exclusive workshop focused on the shift from passive Generative AI to autonomous Agentic AI. The event featured the first live demonstration of Amazon QuickSuite in Vietnam and introduced the AWS LIFT Program to lower financial barriers for adoption.

**Key Objectives:**
*   **Define Agentic AI:** Clarify the concept of autonomous AI agents that can reason and execute tasks.
*   **Introduce Amazon QuickSuite:** Showcase the unified data visualization (QuickSight) and generative AI (Quick Suite Q) platform.
*   **Enable Hands-on Learning:** Provide a practical environment to build AI concepts with expert guidance.
*   **Facilitate Adoption:** Offer an $80,000 USD credit through the AWS LIFT Program to accelerate R&D.

#### Key Takeaways & Learnings

*   **Focus on Autonomy:** The design goal of Agentic AI is to build systems that act on a user's behalf, not just provide information.
*   **Ecosystem Approach is Crucial:** Effective agents require a connected network of tools, like the one provided by QuickSuite, to link data sources with action logic.
*   **Early Adoption Creates Advantage:** Gaining proficiency with tools like QuickSuite before they become mainstream offers a significant competitive edge.
*   **Funding Accelerates Innovation:** Financial incentives like the LIFT program enable companies to experiment and innovate more quickly.
