However, with the introduction of many more new large language models (LLMs) and the identification of issues such as hallucination, limited context window length, prompt engineering, and cost, the generative AI community has realized that more features and functionalities should be added to use LLMs safely and efficiently in an enterprise environment.\nThese combined complexities have made it challenging for enterprises and organizations to quickly embrace generative AI. Such challenges include lacking generative AI expertise and staff, having no framework to evaluate different models, lacking model deployment mechanisms, not knowing how to implement guardrails and monitoring for LLMs or how to combine traditional predictive AI with generative AI, and more. Overall, enterprises and organizations need a consolidated tool that can tackle these challenges while requiring minimal AI expertise and an affordable budget.\nDataRobot, an AWS Partner and AWS Marketplace seller, provides a solution to address these challenges. DataRobot is a complete AI lifecycle platform that offers both predictive and generative AI capabilities with a low-code no-code (LCNC) design to help enterprises and organizations deliver business value and drive innovation with AI at a faster pace. DataRobot has achieved AWS Competencies in ML, data and analytics, and financial services, and holds the AWS Service Ready Specialization for Amazon SageMaker. DataRobot offers various deployment types, including multi-tenant software as a service (SaaS) built on AWS, single-tenant SaaS, and Amazon Virtual Cloud (Amazon VPC) deployment to meet the requirements of different companies and industries.\nThis post is going to introduce the overall architecture of DataRobot AI Platform and also demonstrate how you can build a GenAI application, from LLM selection, prompt testing and model evaluation to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM monitoring and guardrails. Everything has been combined into one unified DataRobot AI platform with a streamlined user experience.\nSolution overview DataRobot’s SaaS platform is built entirely on AWS with a modernized Kubernetes design, providing customers with robust, scalable, and trustworthy AI solutions. AI projects start with data ingestion, where DataRobot provides secure integrations to a wide selection of data sources, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, and Amazon Redshift, as well as data stores from other providers like Snowflake. The following diagram shows the high-level architecture of the solution.\nOverall architecture diagram of DataRobot’s SaaS Figure 1: Overall architecture diagram of DataRobot’s SaaS\nFor predictive AI, you can use DataRobot to store, view, transform, and analyze your data with minimal data science knowledge in just a few clicks. These capabilities are backed by a powerful data processing engine. After data preparation, DataRobot uses its expertise in AutoML, which runs parallel ML training jobs on multiple selected high-quality ML models and all necessary feature processing steps automatically. Trained models are ranked in an integrated leaderboard with detailed information about each model, such as accuracy, feature importance map, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, processing recipes, and prediction explanations. You can deploy your models within DataRobot or to other platforms, such as Amazon SageMaker or Snowflake, within minutes after selecting the best model.\nFor generative AI, DataRobot provides an LLM playground, a space where you can create and interact with LLM blueprints using different leading LLMs, including Anthropic’s Claude in Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon Titan models. The playground has integrated preselected vector databases to let customers to build chat or RAG applications without deep ML expertise. Different LLM blueprints can be created and compared side by side for prompt testing. Various preselected LLM evaluation metrics and custom metrics can be chosen and deployed to monitor the performance of LLMs, which is crucial for enterprise and organizational LLM adoption. After testing the LLM blueprint and deciding on the prompt and metrics, customers can move it into deployment for production.\nFor both predictive and generative AI, DataRobot equips the models with monitoring tools that are quick to set up. The platform can monitor many preselected metrics as well as custom-designed metrics, such as service health, latency, token size, error rate, and cost. For generative AI, DataRobot provides guardrails to help prevent prompt injection, sentiment and toxicity classification, personal identifiable information (PII) detection, and more.\nIn the following sections, we demonstrate the major steps on how you can easily build a predictive and generative AI application in DataRobot.\nIn the walkthrough, you learn how to:\nConnect to data in Amazon S3 and create a data wrangling recipe to prepare the data Build a predictive model within DataRobot and deploy it to Amazon SageMaker Create an LLM blueprint that combines Anthropic’s Claude in Amazon Bedrock with grounding data Evaluate and optimize the blueprint against metrics such as Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), faithfulness, and confidence Package the LLM blueprint with guardrails to maintain safety and performance Launch an AI app that can predict NBO and automatically generate email outreach Prerequisites Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:\nAn AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock models A DataRobot account. DataRobot can be purchased through AWS Marketplace. You can also visit the DataRobot site to request a free trial. Solution walkthrough: Build a predictive and generative AI application powered by Anthropic’s Claude models in DataRobot The use case we demonstrate here is to create a next best offer (NBO) email campaign where the goal is to proactively reach out to customers likely to churn and provide them with an offer that will help retain them as customers.\nWe use a predictive model to recommend the NBO for each customer and then use generative AI to customize the email for each customer.\nStep 1: Connect the data source in Amazon S3 In DataRobot Workbench UI, we can start a new Use Case and add NBO data by connecting to an Amazon S3 bucket. The NBO data is prepared in-house based on the public IBM telco customer churn dataset. Make changes to this dataset by adding another text-based column named “customer plan” and changing the prediction target from Churn Value to Next Best Offer. This change turns the prediction to be a multi-class classification problem. This was derived by applying some common-sense business rules to the reason codes from the original data. Meanwhile, we can create new columns to track how long customers have been on the phone with customer service, providing a key feature for our prediction. Use DataRobot’s data wrangler to create a wrangling recipe with a sample of data and then apply it to the full dataset. Add input data from Amazon S3 in DataRobot UI Figure 2: Add input data from Amazon S3 in DataRobot UI\nStep 2: Create a predictive model for the NBO Once the data preparation is done, we can train a predictive model to predict which type of offer is best suited for a customer in order to avoid churning. To do that, we follow these steps:\nIn DataRobot Workbench UI, start an experiment for model training. For the multiclass type, select Offers as the prediction target. Run Autopilot Register to train a few ML models. Training will take place automatically with preprocessing steps designed uniquely for each different model. All the processing recipes can be viewed in the UI, shown as blueprint, so customers can view what’s really happening before the actual model training. This is shown in the following screenshot. Blueprint for modeling and processing recipes Figure 3: Blueprint for modeling and processing recipes\nThese recipes can finish in minutes given the small size of the tested datasets. When you deploy the model, you can directly deploy it within DataRobot without worrying about the underlining infrastructure. You also have the option to deploy it into Amazon SageMaker with one-click deployment, as shown in the following screenshot. This provides great flexibility for choosing deployment infrastructure.\nSageMaker one-click model deployment within DataRobot] Figure 4: SageMaker one-click model deployment within DataRobot\nStep 3: Create the LLM blueprint Once we have finished deploying the predictive model, we can build the generative AI part of the application, which is a RAG setup. Several market leading LLMs are already available in the DataRobot’s LLM playground, such as Anthropic’s Claude from Amazon Bedrock and the Amazon Titan model, as well as models from other providers, giving customers a great choice in selecting the right model for their applications.\nNavigate to the LLM playground from DataRobot Workbench and create an LLM blueprint by picking the Claude 3 model as the LLM from the drop-down list. After the model has been selected, several LLM related parameters can be adjusted to tune the results, such as Max completion tokens, Temperature and Token selection probability cutoff. On the same page, vector databases and system prompts can be configured to work with the LLM. At this time, users can try different combinations of LLM, chunking strategy, and prompting strategy to derive an optimal result. Users can build multiple blueprints and compare them against different metrics such as ROUGE, confidence, and faithfulness. The data we used to send to the vector database is a collection of five internal plan documents discussing various details of the cell phone plans. The following screenshot shows the LLM playground UI.\nDataRobot LLM playground UI Figure 5: DataRobot LLM playground UI\nStep 4: Set up LLM guardrails Once the LLM blueprint has been created and tested, choose the LLM blueprint actions and then choose Send to model workshop. In the model workshop, adjust the runtime environment variables as needed. The Evaluation and moderation section contains metrics that you can pick to evaluate the model performance and safety over time. DataRobot provides some of the ready-to-use metrics to get started, such as PII detection, sentiment analysis, toxicity, and more. In addition, you can design your own custom metrics based on your unique business logic. After you complete all the configurations, you can test the model or create new versions. DataRobot recommends testing it before deployment. Next, choose Register model, provide the registered model or version details, and then choose Register model again to add the LLM to the Registry. The registered model version opens in the Model directory, which contains the Deploy button for users to quickly deploy the model.

Here we use DataRobot one-click deployment to deploy the model to Amazon SageMaker. Once deployed, we can monitor the performance of both the generative and predictive portions of the app. You can create custom metrics like latency, return on investment (ROI), or readability, which can be viewed under the same pane of glass, no matter whether those models are built in DataRobot, on AWS, or elsewhere. This is shown in the following screenshot.\nMetrics monitoring dashboard Figure 8: Metrics monitoring dashboard\nStep 6: Host application in DataRobot With the predictive and generative models deployed, we can build a web application by utilizing both models and host the application within DataRobot. DataRobot supports hosting custom applications in a variety of frameworks, such as Streamlit, Shiny and Flask. For detailed information on hosting custom applications in DataRobot, please refer to the Create custom applications article in the DataRobot documentation. Here, as an example we use python to build a simple web application with Streamlit. The interface of the application is shown in figure 9. The application picks a customer by name and predicts whether the customer will need a certain type of offer or not to avoid churn. The result of this part is derived from the response of the predictive model we deployed. If it determines the customer needs an offer, the app will leverage the generative model we deployed previously to generate an example email campaign with a purposely curated offer based on the customer’s unique situation. After that, the marketing team can send the email to the customer.\nExample application that combines both predictive and generative AI Figure 9: Example application that combines both predictive and generative AI\nCleanup To clean up the resources created in this walk-through, follow these steps:\nOn the AWS console under the SageMaker panel, remove the SageMaker deployments by deleting the SageMaker endpoints and endpoint configurations. In the DataRobot UI, remove all DataRobot deployments. There are no additional consumption costs for the DataRobot LLM playground or predictive experiments.\nConclusion DataRobot is a comprehensive AI platform for teams to derive values from AI at faster speed.

For the unhoused, being ‘document ready’ is essential to avoid delays or denial of access to benefits and services they need. For one individual in Los Angeles recently, it meant the difference between having a safe bed in a shelter and being in police custody.\nThe issue of document access and related administrative burdens is so ubiquitous that public health researchers have published papers about the detrimental impact a lack of identification has on those experiencing homelessness. Social Security cards, birth certificates, and proof of disability are crucial for accessing services and applying for housing. Without proper documentation, unhoused individuals face overwhelming barriers to stability and opportunity. But new technologies and tools address these problems while helping the organizations who serve vulnerable populations. One innovative solution called Kiip, powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS), takes a unique approach to this problem by empowering individuals with access and control over their own personal, vital documents.\nEmpowering individuals with ownership of their own data\nStarting in July 2023, hundreds of staff at the Homeless Outreach Program Integrated Care System (HOPICS) began using Kiip to store documents, complete forms and applications, and streamline communications with incoming customers. They aimed to provide every person coming through their doors access to their own documents no matter where they went. As one client discovered, you never know when a key document is needed at a critical moment.\nThis past August, police detained a resident of a HOPICS residential shelter as a suspect in a crime. Law enforcement knew the name of the suspect and this individual matched a description but did not have any identification. Unable to prove they were not the perpetrator, police prepared to take the individual into custody. About to be handcuffed, the individual remembered their Kiip account. They explained to the officers that HOPICS set them up with an account that saved all of their identifying documents when they first entered the shelter.\nOpening their phone, they were able to provide copies of their ID, Social Security card, and even a fully signed copy of their intake forms with the HOPICS case manager who set them up with Kiip. With their identity verified, police released the individual.\nThis interaction seems minor but for someone in a vulnerable community, it is potentially life-altering. If this individual remained in custody, they could have lost their bed in the shelter, requiring a restart of their journey towards being permanently housed.\n“When we created Kiip, we believed that helping people have access to their own information would not only improve the process of accessing benefits and services but would help them in a host of other needs beyond any one interaction,” said Noah Harlan, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Kiip. “We built Kiip to help individuals overcome administrative burdens faced when obtaining benefits and services, but also to reduce the punishing cognitive burdens placed on at-risk and vulnerable communities. We’re thrilled that it’s already helped hundreds of individuals apply for benefits, and now learning that someone was able to help themselves in a potentially dire situation unrelated to their applications was proof that this model works for individuals and communities.”\nUsing technology to improve social services\nHOPICS is one of five housing coordinators for Los Angeles County with a focus on South Los Angeles. With nearly 500 staff, HOPICS provides a broad range of services including shelters for individuals and families, access centers, outreach teams, and community navigation teams providing housing, behavioral health, and reentry support throughout the community. HOPICS was founded by Mike Neely 35 years ago, when he was a homeless veteran sleeping on Skid Row. Neely applied his lived experience to become a community organizer, eventually launching a pilot program with a $50,000 block grant. From that start, HOPICS has helped thousands of individuals.\n“Our partnership with Kiip is changing the way people in Los Angeles engage with the homeless response system by empowering individuals with a resource to store their most vital documents securely,” said Ben Kay, Associate Director of HOPICS for Access and Triage.\nKiip is a cloud-native software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that leverages a host of AWS’s industry-leading features including serverless computing via AWS Lambda, scalable secure storage with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS), and Amazon Cognito for identity management. Kiip is a HIPAA-compliant, scalable solution that ensures every feature is available whenever and wherever needed. Kiip uses some of AWS’s latest and most sophisticated tools, including Amazon Chime for secure multi-party chat and Amazon Bedrock AI tools for private, secure large language model (LLM) document introspection and categorization.\nKiip, working with HOPICS and powered by AWS, enables unhoused individuals to securely keep, manage, and share copies of their vital documents. The solution also provides community-based organizations, agencies, and other service providers secure multi-party chat, document exchange, form filling, and legally binding e-signatures and referrals. Kiip’s core value proposition for its service provider customers is to improve the application process for their services. It uses a “problem solving” modality that pushes information, access, and control back to the individuals themselves by making needed documents accessible and shareable. This inversion of traditional portal software empowers individuals beyond the relationship with just their service provider.\nSince launching in July 2023 with HOPICS, Kiip has served more than 800 clients and securely stored more than 3,500 vital documents—including more than 1,000 applications.\nThe broader impact\nKiip is revolutionizing how a community can approach homelessness and its associated challenges. It empowers individuals, improves the efficiency of service providers, and provides a significant contribution in the battle to end homelessness. When facing the complex issue of homelessness, solutions like Kiip provide hope and practical support to those in need. With organizations like HOPICS leading the way, there are new tools that empower a better future where homelessness is rare and temporary.\nAvailable on AWS Marketplace\nPublic sector organizations need to balance extensive regulatory and compliance obligations with cost-effective procurement strategies. AWS Marketplace helps simplify and streamline procurement for public sector organizations, enabling them to spend their budgets driving their missions forward rather than on administrative overhead.

Healthcare data is growing at such a rapid rate that one study observed the healthcare industry is growing faster than other verticals and contributes approximately 30 percent of the world’s data volume today.\nAs a result, organizations need a secure and easy-to-use data platform in order to centralize and utilize the data efficiently. Databricks on Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a unified data and analytics platform that breaks down these data silos and integrates the data engineering capabilities of Databricks with the secure and reliable infrastructure of AWS.\nWe will walk through how Databricks and AWS, together, can help address large data silos to transform personalized patient care through generative AI and machine learning.\nIndustry challenges driving cloud data platform adoption The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving in how it manages and utilizes data. The industry is increasingly adopting modern data architectures in order to keep up with the quickly changing landscape.\nLet’s explore some of healthcare’s current data challenges:\nDigital transformation in healthcare is driven by a shift away from fee-for-service models to value-based care (VBC) and outcome-based payments. Patient medical history, medical imaging, wearable health information, genomics, and other medical research data play a key role in driving better outcomes for patients. However, the data needs for executing on VBC strategies surpass the capabilities of legacy technologies and require modernization to meet the demands of the business. On-premises data silos result in managing petabytes of data across multiple segments of the organization, which may be locked in different healthcare data modalities. Personalized engagement requires the centralizing of a patient’s data in order to allow for precision medicine based on a patient’s health history and requirements. AI-powered innovations with slow adoption rates hinders the ability to leverage more advanced automation of clinical documentation, and enhanced diagnostic accuracy through AI-assisted imaging. The adoption of generative AI for administrative tasks and patient risk predictions would also benefit patient care. These are driving factors for healthcare customers beginning to adopt modern data strategies in the cloud. The scale and speed of innovation in the cloud enables customers to scale resources for peak times when needed and down-scale when not needed, leading to cost efficiency in storage and compute. Consolidation of data silos also leads to a reduction in the duplication of data—providing a single source of truth.\nDatabricks for healthcare In today’s data-driven healthcare landscape, organizations need robust, secure, and scalable solutions to transform vast amounts of healthcare data into actionable insights. The Data Intelligence Platform from Databricks revolutionizes how organizations can use their data to improve patient outcomes.\nDatabricks serves as a unified open analytics platform for building complete data use cases on a data lakehouse, a term that combines data warehousing and data lakes under one technology. Founded by the creators of Apache Spark, this architecture leverages the scalable nature of cloud technology for storage, data processing, and AI while adding the structure, data governance, and business intelligence experience of traditional data warehouses.\nAWS collaborates with Databricks to bring the powerful data lakehouse platform of Databricks together with the comprehensive cloud infrastructure of AWS. This collaboration provides healthcare organizations with a secure, scalable, and compliant environment for their critical data workloads—enabling innovation to drive improvements to patient care.\nWhy Databricks on AWS Figure 1: High level architecture of data sources and outcomes of Databricks on AWS\nFigure 1: High level architecture of data sources and outcomes of Databricks on AWS\nDatabricks on AWS provides a platform to unify the diverse ecosystem of data silos including all EHR data, medical imaging, laboratory systems, revenue cycles, pharmaceuticals, supply chain, clinical decision support, and more. The decision to run Databricks on AWS represents a strategic choice for healthcare organizations that unlocks tremendous value. It can help with predicting disease onset in real time in inpatient settings, and measuring patient safety metrics (like fall fractures). It can facilitate closing gaps of care with preventative screenings (reducing the length of stay and improving care treatment plans), and optimize provider performance in bundled payment arrangements to name a few.\nThere are several compelling technological advantages of Databricks with AWS.\nAvailability and reliability\nThe foundation of these advantages lies in the AWS global infrastructure, offering the highest availability and resiliency in the industry. Databricks on AWS is available in 13 AWS Regions and multiple Availability Zones per Region. This means healthcare organizations can deploy Databricks workloads with confidence, confirming business continuity and meeting stringent regulatory requirements for data residency and disaster recovery.\nGiving customers simplicity and flexibility for generative AI\nWhile Databricks simplifies the architecture with a lakehouse and accelerates speed to value, AWS provides powerful and flexible tooling. These enable healthcare organizations with unparalleled capabilities to build cutting edge research using generative AI, medical imaging, genomics, autonomous medical coding, drug research and discovery, and personalized treatment plans.\nDatabricks Mosaic AI Gateway supports serving models across all clouds, including those available in Amazon Bedrock which provides access to a choice of leading foundation models (FMs) through a single API. This includes Amazon Titan and Amazon Nova models as well as those from leading AI companies like Anthropic, AI21 Labs, Meta and more. Together, Mosaic AI Gateway and Amazon Bedrock give customers the flexibility and choice to utilize the right model for their use-case leveraging the broad selection of models available in Amazon BedRock in addition to the other models supported by Mosaic AI Gateway.\nDatabricks Mosaic AI provides complete connectivity and transparency between data and AI, powered by its native integration with Unity Catalog’s observability tools which enable improved model accuracy and spending oversight.\nFurthermore, leveraging AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips enables organizations to optimize both training and inference costs while maintaining high performance.\nMaximized return on investment and cost optimization\nHealthcare organizations can leverage AWS Graviton processors, which offer up to 40 percent better price performance compared to traditional x86-based instances. The ability to utilize Amazon EC2 Spot Instances for Databricks workloads can reduce compute costs by up to 90 percent compared to on-demand pricing.\nSpot Instances on AWS provide a two-minute interruption notice before termination, helping customers balance fault tolerance with cost optimization. This cost efficiency extends to data storage through intelligent tiering between Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) storage classes and integration with AWS cost management tools. Healthcare organizations can maintain control over their technology spending while scaling their analytics capabilities.\nAdopting Databricks on AWS also accelerates time-to-insights compared to building and maintaining a custom data analytics platform. Custom solutions require dedicated platform engineers and architects to build and support ongoing operational maintenance activities (such as patching, cluster optimization, and managing data ingestion pipelines). With Databricks on AWS, organizations can re-focus their in-house expertise to extracting value from their data rather than maintaining complex data architectures.\nSecurity and compliance\nSecurity and compliance capabilities are paramount for healthcare organizations. Native integration with AWS security services, including AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encryption key management, AWS PrivateLink for secure network connectivity, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for granular access control, make it straightforward for healthcare organizations to maintain HIPAA compliance and protect sensitive patient data.\nThe Databricks platform’s support for the AWS shared responsibility model provides clear delineation of security obligations, streamlining compliance audits and risk management processes.\nFor customers getting started on AWS, we recommend exploring the AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) for Healthcare.

Why Choose Amazon DynamoDB? With Aurora’s Serverless architecture, Amazon DynamoDB is the ideal choice because:\nServerless: No server management required, automatically scales based on workload. High performance: Low latency (single-digit milliseconds), ideal for real-time UI operations. Flexible (Schemaless): Easy to add new fields to Event/Todo items without complex migrations like SQL databases. 2. Schema Design (Data Modeling) The system follows a Per-User Isolation model.\nEvery item is associated with a userId (extracted from Cognito/Google tokens) to ensure data security.\nWe will create three main tables:\nTable 1: AuroraEvents (Stores calendar events) This table stores user events, displayed on the calendar and used for notification scanning.\nPartition Key (PK): userId (String) — User identifier Sort Key (SK): eventId (String) — UUID of the event Table 2: AuroraTasks (Stores daily tasks) This table stores the user’s Daily Worklog / Todo list.\nPartition Key (PK): userId (String) Sort Key (SK): todoId (String) — UUID of the task Table 3: users (Stores user information) This table contains detailed information about each user.\nPartition Key (PK): userId (String) 3.
